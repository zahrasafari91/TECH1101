            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            <p>The Dandy Brewing Company is Calgary's original small brewery. Although it has grown a little, it's still
                small at heart. We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in small batches.
                Our unique approach to brewing and keen eye to every detail and fosters creativity in both our recipes
                and beer styles. </p>

            <p>On site, we are pleased to offer a unique brewery experience, featuring a full service tasting room with
                an exquisite menu of fine dining drinking food, a curated selection of cocktails, glass pours of selected
                wines, and 20 taps of Dandy beers.
            </p>

            <p>We share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, process, experiences, and personal touches that
                make the real ale experience so special.</p>
